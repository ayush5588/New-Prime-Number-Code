# Prime-Number-Code
A new method to check whether the input number is prime or not

In traditional method we were checking the divisiblity condition from 1st element to the half of the range BUT in this method we are reducing the size of the array with each iteraton.
If the given number (n) is NOT divisible by a particular number (i) of array then we are removing all the multiples of i from the array.
